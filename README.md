# Arduino_Arbike
### Arbike v5.0  
I did lots of changing to this project, it is completely different to the old v2.2.  
So I skip v3.0, directly name it as v4.0 to show it distinct.  
Also, v5 is the most stable version.
However, it is NOT completely done.  
Still have faccgraph, motormode, random, DHT11 parts waiting to update.  
The next version will come soon.
